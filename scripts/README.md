### @Witness
Witness annotation useful as a automatic existential-proof discharger through VDMJ interpreation. That is, a witness to a record type will be type checked and interpreted; if that succeeds, this is akin to an exitentially quantified variable witness useful for later translation to theorem provers. 
 
## experiments
Colleciton of interesting VDM-SL experiments

### Asynch
Attempt to include in VDM-SL what exists in VDM-RT as asynchronous operation calls. This needs some extending.

### Folderol
Larry Paulson's Folderol theorem prover in VDM-SL.

## issues 
Collection of minimal examples highlighting tool issues/errors. These were all reported to and fixed by corresponding tool builders.

### CG
Overture code generator issues. 

### TC
Overture and VDMJ type checker (and occasionally parsing) issues.

## libraries 
Collection of VDM-SL libraries for various uses. 

* **TODO: document each library + fix Support1/2.vdmsl! **
