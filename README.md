# VDM_Toolkit
Repository of various VDM-SL developments.

## annotations
Collection of VDMJ annotation extensions.

### @Time
Time monitoring annotation that works as a specification profiler. Useful to ascertain what part of the specification is taking what kind of time. 

### @Witness
Witness annotation useful as a automatic existential-proof discharger through VDMJ interpreation. That is, a witness to a record type will be type checked and interpreted; if that succeeds, this is akin to an exitentially quantified variable witness useful for later translation to theorem provers. 
 
## experiments
Colleciton of interesting VDM-SL experiments of vaired size and complexity.

## issues 
Collection of minimal examples highlighting tool issues/errors. These were all reported to and fixed by corresponding tool builders.

### CG
Overture code generator issues. 

### TC
Overture and VDMJ type checker (and occasionally parsing) issues.

## libraries 
Collection of VDM-SL libraries for various uses. 

## plugins 
Collection of VDMJ plugins.

## scripts 
Collection of VDMJ scripts useful to make it seemless across updates. Works for Linux/Mac (haven't tested on Windows).
